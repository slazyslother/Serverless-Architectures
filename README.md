# Serverless Architectures

This project involves building a serverless API using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. Serverless architecture allows developers to focus on writing code without managing infrastructure. The API will be integrated with other cloud services like DynamoDB or Firebase for data storage and retrieval. Additionally, the project includes implementing a trigger-based workflow for handling asynchronous tasks, enabling event-driven architecture.

<br/>

## Features

- __Serverless API__: Develop an API using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for serverless execution.
- __Cloud Service Integration__: Integrate with other cloud services like DynamoDB or Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
- __Trigger-Based Workflow__: Implement event-driven architecture for handling asynchronous tasks triggered by events.
- __Scalability__: Utilize the auto-scaling capabilities of serverless platforms to handle varying workloads.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Serverless Function Scripts__: Write scripts or functions to deploy and manage serverless functions.
- __Cloud Service Integration Code__: Develop code to interact with cloud services like DynamoDB or Firebase.
- __Trigger-Based Workflow Configuration__: Configure triggers and workflows to handle asynchronous tasks.

<br/>

## Implementation

- __Serverless Function Development__: Write serverless functions using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions to handle API requests.
- __Cloud Service Integration__: Integrate the serverless functions with cloud services like DynamoDB or Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
- __Trigger-Based Workflow Configuration__: Configure triggers and workflows using services like AWS EventBridge or Google Cloud Pub/Sub to handle asynchronous tasks.
- __Scalability Testing__: Test the scalability of the serverless API by gradually increasing the workload and monitoring performance.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Unit Testing__: Test individual serverless functions to ensure they behave as expected.
- __Integration Testing__: Test the integration between serverless functions and other cloud services.
- __Trigger-Based Workflow Testing__: Verify that triggers and workflows function correctly in response to events.

<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Serverless API Deployment__: Deploy the serverless API to AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
- __Cloud Service Integration__: Integrate the API with DynamoDB or Firebase for data storage and retrieval.
- __Trigger-Based Workflow__: Implement a trigger-based workflow to handle events such as file uploads or database changes.
- __Scalability Test__: Test the scalability of the serverless API by generating varying workloads.
